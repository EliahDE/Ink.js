# DISCONTINUED
**This bot can now be found [HERE](https://github.com/InklingSplasher/Ink.js)!**

# Ink.js
Ink.js is a private Discord-Bot with some useful features!

## Why did I create it?
It's fairly simple, I wanted to develop my very own bot and learn JavaScript, of course, I have not finished learning it yet, but I am making great progress.

## Selfhosting
Feel free to selfhost the bot! 

### Requirements
Please download the latest version of [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](npm here).

### How-To
Just fill out the config.json with your credentials. You can create an application here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/.
You find your ID by enabling Developer Mode in Discord under User Settings -> Appearence -> Developer Mode, then just rightclick your profile and click on 'Copy ID'.  
Then, go into your console and while being in the Ink.js directionary, use the `npm i` command to install the dependencies and after you filled out the config.json file, use the `npm start` command.
