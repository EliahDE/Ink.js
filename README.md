# Ink.js
Ink.js is a private Discord-Bot with some useful features!

## Why did I create it?
It's fairly simple, I wanted to develop my very own bot and learn JavaScript, of course, I have not finished learning it yet, but I am making great progress.

### Notice
This bot is in early development and I was to lazy to catch errors etc. yet.  
Please be indulgent!

## Selfhosting
Feel free to selfhost the bot!  
If you selfhost the bot, there are some **guidelines**:

1. You may not host a public version of Ink.js.
2. You may not charge for the usage of your instance of Ink.js.
3. You may not provide support for Ink.js.
4. You may not act like you programmed it and leave all marks of me having developed it in the code.
### Requirements
Please download the latest version of (npm here)[https://nodejs.org/en/download/].
### How-To
Just fill out the config-example.json with your credentials and rename it to config.json. You can create an application here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/.
You find your ID by enabling Developer Mode in Discord under User Settings -> Appearance -> Developer Mode, then just right click your profile and click on 'Copy ID'.  
Then, go into your console and while being in the Ink.js folder, use the `npm i` command to install the dependencies and after you filled out the config.json file, use the `npm start` command.

## Contributing
You want to help me making my code better, or even add new things to it? Awesome, I'll really appreciate it!
### How-To
Just fork the repository, make your changes and request a merge request, I, or one of the other maintainers will do the rest!
